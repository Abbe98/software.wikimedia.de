        <h2>About you</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>You care about software; you have a passion which you can clearly convey by your actions rather than personal statements on your CV alone</li>
            <li>You have an eye for software design and quality</li>
            <li>You can recognize legacy code and know how to effectively deal with it</li>
            <li>You are able to communicate fluently in English in a multidisciplinary team</li>
            <li>For you it’s more than a job</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We’re interested in candidates from any background, as long as you have a solid understanding of Object Oriented
            languages and basic experience with web development.

        <h2>Technologies we use</h2>

        <p>
            Most of our server side code is written in PHP. A lot of our projects have a HTML 5 & JavaScript frontend,
            which interact with server side backends via web APIs. We test our code with PHPUnit and QUnit, and with
            browser tests written in Ruby. Some of our code is written on top of the MediaWiki framework, some of it is
            entirely in-house and for newer projects we use libraries such as Symfony components and Doctrine.
        </p>

        <p>An (incomplete) list of technologies we're currently using:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript, PHP, Ruby</li>
            <li>MediaWiki, several MediaWiki extensions</li>
            <li>PHPUnit, QUnit, Selenium, Cucumber, PHPCS, PHPMD, JSLint, Rubocop</li>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>MySQL, SQLite</li>
            <li>Composer</li>
            <li>TravisCI, ScrutinizerCI, Jenkins</li>
            <li>Wikimedia Labs infrastructure</li>
            <li>Phabricator</li>
            <li>Linux server, nginx</li>
            <li>Puppet, Vagrant</li>
        </ul>
